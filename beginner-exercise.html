    <h2>Warm-up</h2>
    <p>Start with a 10-minute brisk walk to get your blood flowing and warm up your muscles.</p>
    
    <h2>Cardio</h2>
    <p>After the warm-up, perform 20 minutes of low-intensity cardio such as walking, cycling, or swimming.</p>
    
    <h2>Strength Training</h2>
    <p>Follow the cardio with 10 minutes of bodyweight exercises, including squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks.</p>
    
    <h2>Cool Down</h2>
    <p>Finish the workout with a 5-minute cool-down, consisting of gentle stretching exercises to help prevent muscle soreness.</p>
    
    <h2>Frequency</h2>
    <p>Try to do this workout routine 3 times a week, with at least one rest day in between sessions.</p>
    
    <p>Remember to listen to your body and modify the exercises as needed. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program.</p>
